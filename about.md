Hello everyone 👋🏼, I’m Carlo Jessurun, and I’m a Staff Security Engineer at TRM Labs. I’m focussed on the intersection 
between cloud native security and scaling infrastructure into massive systems. If your team is looking for an experienced 
Staff Security Engineer to scale and secure your services please feel free to reach out via my email. I’m available for 
contracting work under my company StackSecurity. If you want to know more about the stuff I’m working on, let’s chat!
